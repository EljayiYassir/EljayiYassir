<h2> 👨‍🎓🙋‍♂️ About Me 💼🎒: </h2>

I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science at [__Northeastern University - Khoury College of Computer
Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). I have *4+ years* of experience building and deploying machine
learning and deep learning models. Furthermore, I completed courses such as Machine Learning Certification by
[__Stanford University__](https://www.stanford.edu/) and Deep Learning Specialization by [__Andrew
Ng__](https://www.andrewng.org/).

These courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science.
Later, I began to work on projects ranging from pharmaceutical, agricultural, retail, manufacturing and automobile
industries.

I worked at companies such as [__NVIDIA__](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), [__Solbots Technologies Private
Limited__](https://www.solbots.in/) and [__Khoury College of Computer Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/)
as a __Data Scientist__ and generated value from data. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills
that I possess in solving and tackling machine learning problems. Thanks.🙂

## 📽📽 My Kaggle Profile

<img src="https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/didssph-guxJTmZKhsg-unsplash.jpg" width="750" />

I'm very familiar with __Kaggle__ - a website that would help __data scientists__ and __machine learning engineers__ to
explore the data and perform machine learning predictions. I would be taking my time to read the kaggle projects which
give me a good idea about the working of machine learning models. Furthermore, I would read others' code as a result of
which I get a good understanding of the various ways in which a machine learning project could be implemented. Below is
a list of all the work that I did in __Kaggle__. Feel free to take a look and give your feedback! Thanks.

## 🎗🎗 My Volunteer Experience

<img src="https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/absolutvision-82TpEld0_e4-unsplash.jpg" width="750" />


👨‍💼 [__VNR SF__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTgSWJtVshqOZXM1Q8FK_PQ)

* I was a member of VNR SF and I was most influential in driving the goals of the team in helping the community by
providing the needy access to resources and books.
* This gave me a good experience of working with different individuals and learning about their goals and dreams.
* There were a few floods in our region during those times. We as a team went to a few neighborhoods and gave them
access to new books and also explained our initiative to serve the poor and needy by giving them access to all the
resources.
* This experience was really useful for me and the way in which I viewed education in shaping my life.
* This gave me an opportunity to take a look at the poorest neighborhood and understand their needs and demands.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

🎤 [__Crescendo__](https://www.facebook.com/events/the-gallery-cafe/crescendo-the-vnrvjiet-band/1395963707155985/)

* In our engineering college, we had Crescendo which was the singing club where people from different departments in
college came together to sing and learn to enjoy music.
* I was the lead singer during that time.
* Furthermore, I was also directing different groups of people to sing and also play musical instruments respectively.
* It was a really good experience to learn from the team the mistakes and correct them and ensure that everything was
going well.
* It shaped the way in which I viewed music which was to not just sing but also enjoy the process.
* My 2 years of working with Crescendo really helped in handling practical aspects of life as well.
* Overall, it was a good and amazing experience to learn from a group of people from different departments in my college
and it was really influential.
