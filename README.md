<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science at [__Northeastern University - Khoury College of Computer
Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). I have *4+ years* of experience building and deploying machine
learning and deep learning models. Furthermore, I completed courses such as Machine Learning Certification by
[__Stanford University__](https://www.stanford.edu/) and Deep Learning Specialization by [__Andrew
Ng__](https://www.andrewng.org/).

These courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science.
Later, I began to work on projects ranging from pharmaceutical, agricultural, retail, manufacturing and automobile
industries.

I worked at companies such as [__NVIDIA__](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), [__Solbots Technologies Private
Limited__](https://www.solbots.in/) and [__Khoury College of Computer Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/)
as a __Data Scientist__ and generated value from data. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills
that I possess in solving and tackling machine learning problems. Thanks.üôÇ

<h2>ü™öüîß My Skills üòÄüòÄ:</h2>

Starting at a young age, I acquired coding skills by initially learning the __C__ language. Currently, I am expanding my
knowledge by studying Python, which enhances my comprehension of machine learning and data science. Consequently, I have
developed a strong grasp of coding principles. Additionally, I have furthered my expertise by gaining proficiency in
other programming languages, including __R__, which are essential for pursuing a career as a __machine learning
engineer__ or a __data scientist__.

Throughout my experience in the field of data science and machine learning, I have acquired a comprehensive set of
skills. These valuable tools and techniques have empowered me to successfully develop and comprehend intricate machine
learning projects.

## üìΩüìΩ My Kaggle Profile

<img src="https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/didssph-guxJTmZKhsg-unsplash.jpg" width="750" />

I'm very familiar with __Kaggle__ - a website that would help __data scientists__ and __machine learning engineers__ to
explore the data and perform machine learning predictions. I would be taking my time to read the kaggle projects which
give me a good idea about the working of machine learning models. Furthermore, I would read others' code as a result of
which I get a good understanding of the various ways in which a machine learning project could be implemented. Below is
a list of all the work that I did in __Kaggle__. Feel free to take a look and give your feedback! Thanks.

## üéóüéó My Volunteer Experience

<img src="https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/absolutvision-82TpEld0_e4-unsplash.jpg" width="750" />


üë®‚Äçüíº [__VNR SF__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTgSWJtVshqOZXM1Q8FK_PQ)

* I was a member of VNR SF and I was most influential in driving the goals of the team in helping the community by
providing the needy access to resources and books.
* This gave me a good experience of working with different individuals and learning about their goals and dreams.
* There were a few floods in our region during those times. We as a team went to a few neighborhoods and gave them
access to new books and also explained our initiative to serve the poor and needy by giving them access to all the
resources.
* This experience was really useful for me and the way in which I viewed education in shaping my life.
* This gave me an opportunity to take a look at the poorest neighborhood and understand their needs and demands.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

üé§ [__Crescendo__](https://www.facebook.com/events/the-gallery-cafe/crescendo-the-vnrvjiet-band/1395963707155985/)

* In our engineering college, we had Crescendo which was the singing club where people from different departments in
college came together to sing and learn to enjoy music.
* I was the lead singer during that time.
* Furthermore, I was also directing different groups of people to sing and also play musical instruments respectively.
* It was a really good experience to learn from the team the mistakes and correct them and ensure that everything was
going well.
* It shaped the way in which I viewed music which was to not just sing but also enjoy the process.
* My 2 years of working with Crescendo really helped in handling practical aspects of life as well.
* Overall, it was a good and amazing experience to learn from a group of people from different departments in my college
and it was really influential.

During my work and my LinkedIn contributions, I came across a wonderful set of people who allowed me to exhibit my
talents and skills and made my learning experience easy. Furthermore, they were also influential in giving me the right
guidance and direction which shaped my interest in machine learning and data science. Below are some wonderful people
who were influential and learned about my work in the field of data science and artificial intelligence.

‚úÖ [__name__](link) - He is a Data Scientist at
[__Apple__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) and saw my work through LinkedIn Contributions. He gave me a good
idea about connecting with people through LinkedIn and Networking events. Furthermore, I discussed my projects with him
and got a good idea about some of the improvements that could be made in real-time projects. This gave me a good idea
about the overall workflow of machine learning and data science starting from Visualization to the Deployment of the
models.

Furthermore, I'm also a __gamer__ and where I spend some time gaming on steam and other platforms. Sometimes it would be
good to spend time doing activities other than reading which would ensure that we could most effectively use our time
for doing other activities as well. Below are some platforms where I usually game mostly.
