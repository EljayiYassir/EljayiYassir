## 📽📽 My Kaggle Profile

I'm very familiar with __Kaggle__ - a website that would help __data scientists__ and __machine learning engineers__ to
explore the data and perform machine learning predictions. I would be taking my time to read the kaggle projects which
give me a good idea about the working of machine learning models. Furthermore, I would read others' code as a result of
which I get a good understanding of the various ways in which a machine learning project could be implemented. Below is
a list of all the work that I did in __Kaggle__. Feel free to take a look and give your feedback! Thanks.
